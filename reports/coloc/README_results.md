# Coloc Results (current)

**Status:** Pipeline complete. **Current coloc yield: 0 strong hits (PP.H4 > 0.8).**

Reason: limited overlap between GWAS variants and GTEx QTL variant IDs under strict thresholds and harmonization constraints.

To improve yield, we can:
- expand the GWAS p‑value window (e.g., 1e‑5)
- add rsID mapping via dbSNP/Ensembl
- include additional eQTL sources (eQTL Catalogue)

This repository is intended to showcase the end‑to‑end workflow regardless of yield.
